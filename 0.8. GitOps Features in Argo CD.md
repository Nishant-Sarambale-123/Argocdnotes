## 🔹 8. GitOps Features in Argo CD

| Feature                    | Description                                                                                       |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Single Source of Truth** | Git holds the desired state of all infrastructure and applications. No manual config on clusters. |
| **Auditability**           | Git commit history tracks who changed what, when, and why – great for audits & reviews.           |
| **Rollback**               | Easily revert to a known good state by checking out or syncing to a previous Git commit.          |
| **Self-Healing**           | Argo CD monitors drift between Git and cluster. With `selfHeal`, it restores the correct state.   |

## 🔍 Detailed Breakdown

### ✅ 1. **Single Source of Truth**

* Everything is stored in Git: manifests, Helm charts, overlays.
* Promotes consistency across environments (dev → prod).
* No need to manually configure clusters.

> 📘 Example: `deployment.yaml`, `service.yaml`, `Application.yaml` all stored under a Git path like `apps/my-app`.

---

### ✅ 2. **Auditability**

* Git log provides full traceability: who changed what and when.
* Supports pull requests, code reviews, approvals.
* Integrates with GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket for visibility.

> 📌 Helps teams meet compliance & security requirements.

---

### ✅ 3. **Rollback**

* Revert to a previous Git commit/tag.
* Argo CD will detect the change and sync the app.
* Easy recovery from faulty deployments.

> 🧠 Use case: Roll back a bad image or misconfigured resource by syncing an older Git commit.

---

### ✅ 4. **Self-Healing**

* Automatically fixes *drift* between Git and cluster.
* Enabled via `syncPolicy.automated.selfHeal: true`.
* Reapplies Git-defined state when resources are manually changed or deleted in the cluster.

> 🔁 Ensures the actual state always reflects what's in Git.

## 🧠 Interview Questions & Answers

---

### Q1: **How does Argo CD implement GitOps?**

**Answer:**
Argo CD uses Git repositories as the source of truth for Kubernetes configurations. It continuously monitors the repo and applies changes to the cluster. Syncing can be manual or automated.

---

### Q2: **What happens if someone manually edits a resource in the cluster?**

**Answer:**
If `selfHeal` is enabled in `syncPolicy`, Argo CD will detect the drift and automatically revert the changes to match the Git-defined state.

---

### Q3: **How can GitOps help with security and compliance?**

**Answer:**
All changes go through version-controlled Git workflows (PRs, reviews), providing full audit logs and preventing unauthorized changes.

---

### Q4: **How does Argo CD handle rollbacks in GitOps?**

**Answer:**
You can roll back by reverting the Git commit or checking out a previous tag. Argo CD will detect the new commit and sync the cluster back to that state.

---

### Q5: **Can Argo CD sync changes from multiple Git repos?**

**Answer:**
Yes. Each `Application` resource can point to a different Git repo and path, allowing fine-grained, multi-repo setups.

---

## 📌 Real-World Scenarios

---

### 📌 Scenario 1: **An engineer manually deletes a `ConfigMap` in production.**

**Expected Behavior:**

* Argo CD detects the missing resource.
* If `selfHeal` is enabled, it will automatically recreate the `ConfigMap` from the Git repo.

---

### 📌 Scenario 2: **You deployed a buggy version of an app.**

**Action:**

* Revert to the previous Git commit using:

  ```bash
  git revert <commit-sha>
  git push
  ```
* Argo CD will sync to the rolled-back version.

---

### 📌 Scenario 3: **You need to check who introduced a faulty resource.**

**Solution:**

* Use:

  ```bash
  git log <path/to/file>
  ```
* Review commits and find the author + timestamp + diff.

---

### 📌 Scenario 4: **Your production cluster is out of sync with Git.**

**Resolution:**

* Argo CD UI or CLI will show the app as `OutOfSync`.
* You can run:

  ```bash
  argocd app sync my-app
  ```
* Or let auto-sync handle it.

---

## ✅ Bonus GitOps Best Practices

* Use **branch-per-environment** (e.g., `dev`, `stage`, `prod`)
* Enable **auto-sync + selfHeal** in lower environments
* Use **manual sync** and approvals in production
* Store **Application** manifests in separate `envs/` Git repo
