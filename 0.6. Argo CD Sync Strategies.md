Here’s a **detailed explanation of Argo CD Sync Strategies**, including **manual and auto-sync**, **sync hooks/waves**, **interview Q\&A**, and **real-world scenarios**.

## 🔹 6. Argo CD Sync Strategies

Argo CD ensures that your **Kubernetes cluster state matches the desired state defined in Git**. How it syncs the two depends on the strategy you choose:

---

### ✅ 1. **Manual Sync**

* Default sync strategy.
* **Changes in Git do NOT trigger automatic deployment**.
* A user must initiate sync via:

  * Argo CD UI
  * CLI:

    ```bash
    argocd app sync my-app
    ```
  * API

🧠 Best for **sensitive environments** like production, where every deployment must be reviewed.

---

### ✅ 2. **Auto-Sync**

* Argo CD automatically applies Git changes to the cluster.
* Detects:

  * Git commits (polling Git or via webhook)
  * Drift between desired and actual state
* Enables:

  * **Continuous Deployment**
  * **Self-healing** clusters (if something is manually changed in the cluster)

#### 📝 YAML Example:

```yaml
syncPolicy:
  automated:
    prune: true         # Deletes resources removed from Git
    selfHeal: true      # Re-applies config if it’s changed manually in cluster
```

### 🔄 Sync Policy Options

| Field        | Description                                                            |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `prune`      | Deletes Kubernetes objects that were removed from Git                  |
| `selfHeal`   | Automatically reverts out-of-band (manual) changes in the cluster      |
| `allowEmpty` | (Optional) Allows syncing even when no resources are found in Git path |

## 🔁 Sync Hooks and Sync Waves

### 🔧 Sync Hooks

* Allow you to run custom **Jobs or resources at specific points** during sync.
* Types:

  * `PreSync` – before syncing
  * `Sync` – during sync
  * `PostSync` – after sync
  * `SyncFail` – on sync failure

#### 📝 Example (Helm Hook Annotation):

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/hook: PreSync
```

🧠 Use cases:

* Database migration
* Backup before deployment
* Notify teams (Slack/email)

---

### 🌊 Sync Waves

* Control **execution order** of resources during a sync.
* Lower wave number = earlier execution.

#### Example:

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave: "0"
```

🧠 Useful when some resources depend on others (e.g., CRDs before CRs).

## 🧠 Interview Questions + Answers

### Q1: **What is the difference between manual and auto-sync in Argo CD?**

**Answer:**

* **Manual** requires user intervention to deploy Git changes.
* **Auto-sync** applies changes automatically when Git is updated.

---

### Q2: **What does `prune` and `selfHeal` do in auto-sync?**

**Answer:**

* `prune`: Deletes obsolete resources not present in Git.
* `selfHeal`: Reverts manual changes in the cluster to match Git.

---

### Q3: **What are Sync Hooks, and when would you use them?**

**Answer:**
Sync Hooks are lifecycle events (`PreSync`, `PostSync`, etc.) used to run extra logic (e.g., database migration, custom cleanup). You annotate resources to mark their hook type.

---

### Q4: **What is a Sync Wave in Argo CD?**

**Answer:**
Sync Waves define the order in which resources are applied during a sync. Resources with lower wave numbers run before higher numbers. It’s useful for controlling dependency order.

---

## 📌 Scenario-Based Q\&A

### 📌 Scenario 1: **You enabled auto-sync but deleted a resource manually from the cluster. What happens?**

**Answer:**

* If `prune: true` is set, Argo CD will **recreate the resource** automatically.
* If `selfHeal: true` is also set, any out-of-band changes will be reverted as well.

---

### 📌 Scenario 2: **You need to run a backup script before syncing a new app version. What should you use?**

**Answer:**

* Use a Kubernetes Job with `PreSync` hook:

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/hook: PreSync
```

---

### 📌 Scenario 3: **Your Helm chart deploys CRDs and CRs. Some CRs fail due to missing CRDs. What can you do?**

**Answer:**

* Use **Sync Waves**:

  * Assign `sync-wave: "0"` to CRDs
  * Assign `sync-wave: "1"` to CRs

---

### 📌 Scenario 4: **You want to ensure only reviewed changes get deployed to production. What sync strategy fits best?**

**Answer:**

* Use **Manual Sync**
* Combine with Argo CD's **role-based access control (RBAC)** to ensure only authorized users can sync.

---

## 🔐 Best Practices

* 🔒 Use manual sync for production, auto-sync for lower environments.
* ✅ Always combine auto-sync with `prune` and `selfHeal` for true GitOps.
* 🧪 Use sync hooks for DB changes, backups, and alerts.
* 🔄 Use sync waves for resource dependency management.
