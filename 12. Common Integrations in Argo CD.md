Here's a detailed explanation of **Argo CD Common Integrations**, with **examples**, **interview questions**, and **scenario-based answers** for better understanding and job preparation.

## 🔌 12. Common Integrations in Argo CD

Argo CD is designed to be GitOps-native and works well with common Kubernetes configuration tools and external systems like Vault and Slack.

---

### 🔹 1. **Helm Integration**

Argo CD natively supports **Helm charts** (v2 & v3).

✅ **Use case:** Template-based configuration of Kubernetes resources.

🧾 **How it works:**

```yaml
source:
  repoURL: https://github.com/org/my-helm-chart
  targetRevision: main
  path: chart-path
  helm:
    values: |
      image:
        tag: "v1.2.3"
```

📌 Supports:

* `values.yaml`
* Inline values
* Helm parameters overrides

---

### 🔹 2. **Kustomize Integration**

Argo CD has **first-class support for Kustomize**, used to customize raw, template-free YAML files.

✅ **Use case:** Overlay per environment (`base/`, `overlays/dev`, `overlays/prod`)

🧾 Example:

```yaml
source:
  repoURL: https://github.com/org/kustomize-configs
  path: overlays/staging
  targetRevision: main
  kustomize:
    images:
      - nginx=nginx:1.19.6
```

---

### 🔹 3. **Jsonnet**

Jsonnet is a data templating language that Argo CD can use via plugins.

✅ **Use case:** Complex logic, DRY configs across environments.

⚙️ Requires enabling the `jsonnet` plugin or external plugin.

🧾 Basic example (custom plugin setup needed):

```yaml
source:
  repoURL: https://github.com/org/jsonnet-app
  path: configs
  directory:
    recurse: true
```

---

### 🔹 4. **Vault (Secrets Integration)**

Use tools like **argocd-vault-plugin** to inject secrets from HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.

✅ **Use case:** Secure management of credentials outside Git.

🔐 **Example setup:**

In `argocd-repo-server` container, mount vault plugin and update Argo CD config to run the plugin.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: argocd-cm
data:
  configManagementPlugins: |
    - name: vault-plugin
      generate:
        command: ["argocd-vault-plugin"]
```

---

### 🔹 5. **Notifications Controller**

🔔 Argo CD Notifications Controller helps send alerts via Slack, Email, MS Teams, Webhooks, etc.

✅ **Use case:** Trigger alerts on sync success/fail, health changes, or drift.

🧾 Example Slack trigger:

```yaml
triggers:
  - name: on-sync-failed
    condition: app.status.operationState.phase == 'Failed'
    template: sync-failed

templates:
  - name: sync-failed
    slack:
      attachments:
        - text: "Sync failed for app {{.app.metadata.name}}"
```

📩 Also supports:

* SMTP
* MS Teams
* Discord
* Webhooks

## 🧠 Interview Questions + Sample Answers

---

### Q1: **How does Argo CD support Helm?**

**Answer:**
Argo CD natively supports Helm v2/v3 charts. It can use values from `values.yaml`, inline values, or pass Helm parameters directly. It also supports Helm dependencies and private repositories.

---

### Q2: **What’s the difference between using Kustomize and Helm in Argo CD?**

**Answer:**

* **Helm** is templating-based and great for parameterized charts.
* **Kustomize** overlays raw YAML and is more declarative.
  Both are supported natively, and the choice depends on the complexity and preferences of the team.

---

### Q3: **How do you handle secrets securely in Argo CD?**

**Answer:**
Using `argocd-vault-plugin` or SOPS, you can fetch secrets from Vault or decrypt secrets at runtime. Secrets are never stored in Git and can be injected dynamically during manifest rendering.

---

### Q4: **How does Argo CD send notifications to external systems?**

**Answer:**
With the Argo CD Notifications Controller. You define triggers and templates and configure notifiers like Slack or email in a `ConfigMap`. It reacts to sync and health events.

---

### Q5: **Have you used Jsonnet with Argo CD?**

**Answer:**
Yes, Jsonnet support requires a plugin in Argo CD, which renders Jsonnet into Kubernetes manifests. It's powerful for creating dynamic, reusable configuration logic, especially in large environments.

---

## ✅ Real-World Scenarios

---

### 🔸 Scenario 1: Helm for Microservices

You use a single Helm chart with different `values.yaml` files per microservice and environment (dev, staging, prod). Argo CD selects the appropriate file based on path and revision.

---

### 🔸 Scenario 2: Secret Injection via Vault

Your company uses HashiCorp Vault. You integrate `argocd-vault-plugin` to inject secrets at render time without ever committing them to Git.

---

### 🔸 Scenario 3: Notifications for Production Apps

You configure Argo CD to send Slack alerts to `#prod-alerts` when a production app's sync fails or the app becomes degraded.
