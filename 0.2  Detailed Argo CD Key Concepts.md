## üîπ Detailed Argo CD Key Concepts

### 1. **Application**

* The **main resource** in Argo CD.
* Defines the **desired state** of a Kubernetes app as declared in a Git repository.
* Contains:

  * `source`: Git repo, path, chart name
  * `destination`: cluster & namespace
  * `syncPolicy`: auto/manual sync
  * `project`: optional grouping of apps
* Managed via YAML, CLI (`argocd app`), or Argo CD UI.

üß† **Use case:** You define your app as an Argo CD `Application` YAML pointing to your Helm chart repo. When a new commit is pushed, Argo CD can sync it automatically.

---

### 2. **Source**

* The Git repository (or Helm repo) that stores:

  * Raw Kubernetes YAMLs
  * Helm Charts
  * Kustomize configurations
* Argo CD **pulls from this Git repo**, not pushes.

üß† **Note:** This is a GitOps principle ‚Äî **Git is the single source of truth**.

---

### 3. **Destination**

* The **target Kubernetes cluster and namespace** where the app should be deployed.
* Example:

  ```yaml
  destination:
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
    namespace: default
  ```

üß† **Multi-cluster deployments**: You can manage apps across clusters by registering external clusters in Argo CD.

---

### 4. **Sync**

* Reconciles the app in the cluster to match what‚Äôs in Git.
* Types:

  * **Manual Sync**: You trigger it via UI/CLI.
  * **Automated Sync**: Argo CD automatically applies changes when Git is updated.
* Also supports **hooks** (pre/post sync jobs), **sync waves**, and **retry/backoff policies**.

---

### 5. **Health Status**

* Determines the **state of application resources** (like pods, deployments).
* Statuses:

  * `Healthy`: All resources are functioning properly.
  * `Degraded`: Something failed (e.g., pod crashloop, missing secret).
  * `Progressing`: Resources are being updated.
  * `Missing`: Expected resources are not found.
  * `Unknown`: Unable to determine status.

üß† Used heavily in dashboards, alerts, and rollbacks.

## üß† Interview Questions + Answers

### Q1: **What is an Application in Argo CD?**

**Answer:**
An Application is the main Argo CD resource that represents a deployment. It connects a Git repo (source) with a Kubernetes cluster (destination), and keeps the actual state in sync with the desired state defined in Git.

---

### Q2: **How does Argo CD implement GitOps principles?**

**Answer:**
Argo CD continuously monitors Git repositories for changes and syncs Kubernetes cluster state to match. It follows a **pull-based** model, ensuring the cluster state always reflects the Git repo.

---

### Q3: **What are some common health statuses in Argo CD?**

**Answer:**

* `Healthy`: All resources working as expected.
* `Degraded`: At least one resource failed.
* `Progressing`: Changes are being applied.
* `Missing`: Expected resources are not found.
* `Unknown`: Argo CD cannot determine status.

---

### Q4: **What‚Äôs the difference between manual and automated sync in Argo CD?**

**Answer:**

* **Manual Sync**: Requires user action (via UI/CLI).
* **Automated Sync**: Argo CD automatically detects Git changes and applies them without manual intervention.

---

### Q5: **How does Argo CD support multi-cluster deployments?**

**Answer:**
You can register multiple Kubernetes clusters with Argo CD. Each Application specifies its own `destination` (cluster + namespace), allowing deployment to any registered cluster.

---

## üéØ Scenario-Based Questions + Sample Answers

### üìå Scenario 1: **You pushed new changes to the Git repo, but the app is not updating in the cluster. What could be wrong?**

**Answer:**

* Check if **sync policy** is set to manual ‚Äî app won‚Äôt update automatically.
* Verify if **auto-sync is disabled**.
* Confirm Argo CD has **access to the Git repo** and the repo is reachable.
* Inspect the Application status for **sync errors** or validation failures.

---

### üìå Scenario 2: **Your application shows Degraded health. How would you troubleshoot it?**

**Answer:**

* Look at **resource-level status** in the UI or CLI (`argocd app get <app>`).
* Inspect logs of specific pods (`kubectl logs`).
* Ensure dependent resources (e.g., ConfigMaps, Secrets) are present.
* Check if the **namespace exists** and has the right permissions.

---

### üìå Scenario 3: **You want to roll back to a previous version of the app. How do you do it?**

**Answer:**

* Use:

  ```bash
  argocd app rollback <app-name> <revision>
  ```
* Or select a previous commit in the Argo CD UI and sync that version.

---

### üìå Scenario 4: **You have different environments (dev, stage, prod). How do you manage them in Argo CD?**

**Answer:**

* Use **multiple Applications**, each pointing to a different path or branch in the Git repo.
* Use **Helm values files** or **Kustomize overlays** for environment-specific configuration.
* Separate environments into **Argo CD Projects** for access control.

---

## üîê Bonus: Security Tips for Argo CD

* Restrict user access via **RBAC policies**.
* Use **SSO integrations** (OIDC, LDAP).
* Set **read-only** access to sensitive environments.
* **Encrypt secrets** using tools like **Sealed Secrets** or **Vault**.
* Always enable **TLS** for the UI and API.
