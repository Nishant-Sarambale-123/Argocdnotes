Here are **detailed notes** on **Argo CD**:

---

### **1. What is Argo CD?**

**Argo CD (Argo Continuous Delivery)** is a **GitOps-based** **continuous delivery** tool designed specifically for **Kubernetes**. It automates deployment, management, and synchronization of application resources by treating **Git as the single source of truth**.

---

### **2. Core Features**

| Feature                   | Description                                                                          |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Declarative GitOps**    | Applications are defined declaratively (YAML/Helm/Kustomize) in Git.                 |
| **Sync with Git**         | Keeps Kubernetes clusters in sync with the Git repository automatically or manually. |
| **Application Status**    | Clearly shows health, sync status, and diff between Git and cluster state.           |
| **Multi-cluster Support** | Can manage deployments to multiple Kubernetes clusters from a single control plane.  |
| **RBAC & SSO**            | Role-based access control and single sign-on integration for secure access.          |
| **Web UI & CLI**          | Provides a rich web-based UI and CLI (`argocd`) for managing applications.           |
| **Audit Logs**            | Tracks who did what and whenâ€”important for compliance.                               |

### **3. How Argo CD Works**

* **Step 1**: Store Kubernetes manifests (or Helm/Kustomize) in a **Git repository**.
* **Step 2**: Create an **Application** in Argo CD that points to the repo, path, and target cluster.
* **Step 3**: Argo CD **continuously compares** the desired state in Git with the actual state in the cluster.
* **Step 4**: If there's a difference, it can either **automatically sync** or allow manual approval to apply changes.
* **Step 5**: Argo CD **applies changes** using `kubectl apply` or Helm/Kustomize mechanisms.

---

### **4. Application Definitions in Argo CD**

Each app is defined with:

* **Name**
* **Git repository URL**
* **Revision (branch, tag, commit)**
* **Path inside the repo**
* **Destination cluster and namespace**
* **Sync policy (manual/auto)**

---

### **5. Synchronization Strategies**

* **Manual Sync**: Argo CD shows a difference; user clicks "Sync".
* **Automated Sync**:

  * Auto-sync on Git changes
  * Optional hooks for pre/post sync
  * Optional self-healing: auto-corrects drift

---

### **6. Deployment Support**

Supports different config management tools:

* **Plain YAML**
* **Helm Charts**
* **Kustomize**
* **Jsonnet**
* **Plugins (e.g., kpt, cue)**

---

### **7. Health Status and Diffing**

* Argo CD shows:

  * **Application health** (Healthy, Degraded, etc.)
  * **Sync status** (Synced, OutOfSync, etc.)
  * **Live diff** between Git and cluster

---

### **8. Security Features**

* **RBAC policies** for fine-grained access
* **SSO support** (OIDC, SAML, LDAP, etc.)
* **Git commit signature verification**
* **Namespace and cluster-scoped access control**
* **Audit trails**

---

### **9. Argo CD CLI**

Useful commands:

```bash
argocd login <argocd-server>
argocd app list
argocd app create ...
argocd app sync <app-name>
argocd app diff <app-name>
argocd app delete <app-name>
```

---

### **10. Use Cases**

* Safe and repeatable Kubernetes application deployment.
* Enforcing desired state from Git.
* Promoting code from dev â†’ staging â†’ prod using Git branches.
* Rollbacks to previous Git commits.
* Multi-team, multi-cluster management.

---

### **11. Argo CD vs Traditional CD**

| Argo CD (GitOps)                    | Traditional CD                           |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Git = source of truth               | Pipeline config = source of truth        |
| Pull-based (cluster pulls from Git) | Push-based (CI server pushes to cluster) |
| Declarative & auditable             | Often imperative & procedural            |
| Self-healing                        | Manual intervention needed               |
| Built-in diff & drift detection     | Lacks visibility post-deployment         |

### ðŸ“˜ **Scenario-Based Questions**

6. **Scenario**: A Git push introduced a misconfiguration, causing app failure.
   **Question**: How can you use Argo CD to roll back to the previous working state?

7. **Scenario**: You want a non-admin developer to deploy apps only to the `dev` namespace.
   **Question**: How can you enforce this using Argo CD RBAC?

8. **Scenario**: You are managing apps across 3 Kubernetes clusters using Argo CD.
