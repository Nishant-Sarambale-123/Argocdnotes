## 🔹 7. Argo CD Application YAML – Explained

### ✅ Basic Example

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: my-app
  namespace: argocd        # Argo CD must manage this resource
spec:
  destination:
    name: ''               # Leave empty if using server field
    namespace: default     # Namespace where app will be deployed
    server: 'https://kubernetes.default.svc'  # In-cluster K8s API
  source:
    path: app-directory    # Directory in the repo with manifests
    repoURL: 'https://github.com/user/repo.git'
    targetRevision: HEAD   # Git branch, tag, or commit (e.g., main)
  project: default
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true          # Delete removed resources
      selfHeal: true       # Auto-correct manual changes
```

## 📘 Field-by-Field Breakdown

| Field                   | Purpose                                                          |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `apiVersion`            | Argo CD CRD version                                              |
| `kind`                  | Must be `Application`                                            |
| `metadata.name`         | Unique name of the application                                   |
| `metadata.namespace`    | Must be `argocd` unless Argo CD is deployed in another namespace |
| `destination.server`    | Target cluster (default K8s API = in-cluster)                    |
| `destination.namespace` | Namespace where app resources go                                 |
| `source.repoURL`        | Git repo URL                                                     |
| `source.path`           | Folder path inside repo with K8s/Helm manifests                  |
| `source.targetRevision` | Git branch, tag, or commit                                       |
| `syncPolicy.automated`  | Enables auto-sync (plus prune + self-heal options)               |

## 🧠 Optional Enhancements (Advanced Use)

### 🔧 Helm Support

```yaml
source:
  repoURL: https://github.com/user/helm-charts
  path: charts/mychart
  targetRevision: main
  helm:
    valueFiles:
      - values-prod.yaml
```

---

### 🧪 Kustomize Support

```yaml
source:
  repoURL: https://github.com/user/repo
  path: overlays/prod
  targetRevision: main
  kustomize:
    namePrefix: prod-
```

---

### 🔐 Add Parameters or Environment Variables

```yaml
source:
  helm:
    parameters:
      - name: image.tag
        value: "v1.2.3"
```

## 🎯 Interview Questions + Answers

### Q1: **What is the purpose of `syncPolicy` in the Application YAML?**

**Answer:**
`syncPolicy` defines whether Argo CD will sync the app automatically or manually. Using `automated` with `prune` and `selfHeal` enables true GitOps behavior.

---

### Q2: **What is the difference between `path` and `repoURL`?**

**Answer:**

* `repoURL` is the Git repository URL.
* `path` is the subfolder inside the repo containing Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts, or Kustomize overlays.

---

### Q3: **Can you deploy to multiple clusters using this YAML?**

**Answer:**
Yes. You can change the `server` field in the `destination` to point to a different cluster (must be registered in Argo CD first).

---

### Q4: **What is the use of `targetRevision`?**

**Answer:**
It tells Argo CD which Git branch, tag, or commit to use. Common values: `main`, `HEAD`, `v1.0.0`, commit SHA.

---

## 📌 Real-World Scenarios

### 📌 Scenario 1: **You want Argo CD to clean up deleted resources from Git. What should you enable?**

**Answer:**
Set:

```yaml
prune: true
```

Under `syncPolicy.automated`. This ensures Argo CD deletes cluster resources removed from Git.

---

### 📌 Scenario 2: **You want to deploy different Helm values per environment (dev/stage/prod).**

**Answer:**
Use Helm `valueFiles`:

```yaml
helm:
  valueFiles:
    - values-dev.yaml
```

Also separate by Git branch or use overlays if using Kustomize.

---

### 📌 Scenario 3: **You want Argo CD to revert changes if someone edits resources manually.**

**Answer:**
Enable:

```yaml
selfHeal: true
```

This instructs Argo CD to watch for drift and reconcile to Git state.

---

### 📌 Scenario 4: **You want to deploy Argo CD Application YAMLs using GitOps.**

**Answer:**

* Store all `Application` YAMLs in a separate Git repo (like `envs/`).
* Create a **"parent" Application** (App of Apps) pointing to that directory.
* Argo CD will read and apply all sub-Applications.

---

## ✅ Final Tips

* Use **`kubectl apply -f application.yaml`** to deploy via GitOps.
* Combine with **GitHub Actions or CI pipeline** to manage promotions.
* Keep `Application` CRs versioned in Git for full audit/history.
