Here's a **detailed explanation of Argo CD's architecture overview**, followed by **interview questions**, **diagrams (if needed later)**, and **scenario-based answers** to help you master the topic:

## üîπ 3. Argo CD Architecture Overview

Argo CD is built as a **Kubernetes-native GitOps controller**, composed of multiple components working together to sync Git with cluster state.

---

### ‚úÖ 1. **Argo CD API Server**

* **Role:** Central interface for all user interactions.
* **Interfaces:**

  * **Web UI**
  * **CLI (`argocd`)**
  * **REST & gRPC API**
* **Auth:** Handles login, session management, token validation.
* **Security:** Integrates with SSO (via Dex), LDAP, or static users.

üß† Think of this as the **entry point** for users and developers.

---

### ‚úÖ 2. **Repository Server**

* **Role:** Pulls Git repositories, parses and **caches manifest files**.
* Supports:

  * **Helm**
  * **Kustomize**
  * **Plain YAML**
* Sends rendered manifests to the Application Controller.

üß† It ensures Git content is continuously available and doesn‚Äôt overload Git services.

---

### ‚úÖ 3. **Application Controller**

* **Core GitOps Engine** üß†
* Watches:

  * `Application` CRs (Custom Resources)
  * Kubernetes cluster state
* Responsibilities:

  * **Detects drift**
  * **Performs sync/auto-sync**
  * Updates health/status of resources
  * Executes **sync hooks** (pre/post)

üß† This is the **brain** of Argo CD. If sync or health status fails ‚Äî this component is responsible.

---

### ‚úÖ 4. **Dex (Optional)**

* **OIDC Identity Provider**
* Supports integration with:

  * GitHub, GitLab, Google, Microsoft, LDAP, SAML, etc.
* Enables **Single Sign-On (SSO)** support in Argo CD.

üß† If you're using corporate auth or need role-based access ‚Äî use Dex.

---

### üß± Additional Notes:

* All Argo CD components run as Kubernetes **pods** (inside the `argocd` namespace).
* **Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)**:

  * Argo CD defines resources like `Application`, `AppProject`.
* **RBAC**:

  * Fine-grained access control to apps and projects.

## üß† Interview Questions + Answers

### Q1: **What is the role of the Argo CD API Server?**

**Answer:**
It acts as the user interface to Argo CD, offering UI, CLI, and API access. It handles authentication, authorization, and routes requests to other components.

---

### Q2: **What does the Repository Server do in Argo CD?**

**Answer:**
It fetches Git content, renders Helm/Kustomize templates, and caches the manifests so that they can be used by the Application Controller during sync operations.

---

### Q3: **What is the Application Controller and why is it important?**

**Answer:**
It watches `Application` CRs and reconciles the actual state in the cluster with the desired state in Git. It performs drift detection, sync operations, and updates resource health.

---

### Q4: **What is Dex used for in Argo CD?**

**Answer:**
Dex is used for OIDC-based authentication. It enables SSO and integration with identity providers like GitHub, LDAP, Google, and more.

---

### Q5: **How does Argo CD ensure GitOps principles in its architecture?**

**Answer:**
Argo CD implements a **pull-based** model where the Application Controller pulls configurations from Git via the Repository Server and syncs them with the cluster. The Git repository is the single source of truth.

---

## üß™ Scenario-Based Questions + Sample Answers

### üìå Scenario 1: **Users can't log into the Argo CD UI with GitHub credentials. What might be wrong?**

**Answer:**

* Dex integration might be misconfigured.
* GitHub client ID/secret might be incorrect or expired.
* OIDC connector in Dex might be down.
* API Server might not be redirecting correctly after login.

---

### üìå Scenario 2: **Sync is not working even though changes are pushed to Git. What‚Äôs your debugging approach?**

**Answer:**

* Check if the **Repository Server** is able to reach the Git repo.
* Confirm the **Application Controller logs** for sync errors.
* Ensure the **Application** object is configured correctly (auto-sync enabled?).
* Validate network/DNS issues between Argo CD and Git.

---

### üìå Scenario 3: **The UI is working but the manifests are not rendering. What could be wrong?**

**Answer:**

* The **Repository Server** may be failing to pull or parse Helm/Kustomize files.
* The Git branch/path may be wrong.
* Helm values file or Kustomize overlays may be misconfigured.
* Invalid syntax in the manifest files.

---

### üìå Scenario 4: **You want to deploy Argo CD in production with high availability. What would you do?**

**Answer:**

* Use **HA mode** with multiple replicas of API Server and Application Controller.
* Enable **Redis and PostgreSQL external storage** (if using Argo CD Enterprise).
* Deploy behind a **Load Balancer**.
* Store Git credentials and secrets in a secure vault.
* Use **SSO** and **RBAC** for access control.
