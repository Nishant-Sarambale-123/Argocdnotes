Here‚Äôs a **complete and detailed explanation of Argo CD Sync Hooks**, including use cases, YAML examples, and interview questions with scenario-based answers.

## üîπ 9. Argo CD Sync Hooks

**Sync hooks** in Argo CD are Kubernetes `Job` resources used to insert custom logic at different stages of the sync process.

They enable **fine-grained control** over deployments ‚Äî e.g., perform database migrations, backups, validations, or cleanups during sync.

---

### ‚úÖ Sync Hook Phases

| Hook Name    | Description                                                                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **PreSync**  | Runs **before** resources are applied. Ideal for backups, pre-checks.          |
| **Sync**     | Runs **in place of** the main sync if defined. Can fully replace default sync. |
| **PostSync** | Runs **after** resources are applied. Use for cleanup, notifications.          |
| **SyncFail** | Runs **only if sync fails**. Helpful for alerting or rollback actions.         |

---

### üßæ How to Define a Sync Hook

Hooks are defined as `Job` resources with annotations:

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: pre-sync-job
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/hook: PreSync
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: prehook
          image: busybox
          command: ["sh", "-c", "echo PreSync logic here"]
      restartPolicy: Never
```

Add this YAML to the same Git repo and path as the app resources.

---

## üîÅ Example: All Sync Hooks

```yaml
# PreSync hook - Run DB backup
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: db-backup
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/hook: PreSync
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: backup
        image: alpine
        command: ["sh", "-c", "echo Backing up database"]
      restartPolicy: Never
---
# PostSync hook - Notify via Slack
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: notify
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/hook: PostSync
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: notify
        image: curlimages/curl
        command: ["curl", "-X", "POST", "https://slack.com/api/send-msg"]
      restartPolicy: Never
---
# SyncFail hook - Rollback/notify
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: rollback
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/hook: SyncFail
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: rollback
        image: alpine
        command: ["sh", "-c", "echo Rollback on failure"]
      restartPolicy: Never
```

---

## üéØ Hook Behavior and Retry

| Annotation                                                  | Meaning                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `argocd.argoproj.io/hook-delete-policy: HookSucceeded`      | Delete hook only on success      |
| `argocd.argoproj.io/hook-delete-policy: BeforeHookCreation` | Clean up old hook before new one |
| `argocd.argoproj.io/hook: Skip`                             | Exclude resource from sync       |

You can combine multiple annotations as needed.

## üß† Interview Questions + Answers

---

### Q1: **What are Sync Hooks in Argo CD?**

**Answer:**
They are Kubernetes `Job` resources annotated to run at various sync phases (`PreSync`, `Sync`, `PostSync`, `SyncFail`). They allow executing custom logic during the sync process.

---

### Q2: **When would you use a PreSync vs PostSync hook?**

**Answer:**

* **PreSync**: For tasks like taking backups, setting feature flags, pre-validation.
* **PostSync**: For tasks like clean-up, triggering notifications, cache refreshes.

---

### Q3: **How do you ensure a hook runs only on successful syncs?**

**Answer:**
Use `argocd.argoproj.io/hook-delete-policy: HookSucceeded` to clean it only on success. PostSync hooks only run after a successful sync anyway.

---

### Q4: **What happens if a hook fails?**

**Answer:**
If any `PreSync` or `Sync` hook fails, the whole sync is marked as failed. Argo CD then optionally runs a `SyncFail` hook if defined.

---

### Q5: **Can hooks be re-run automatically?**

**Answer:**
Yes, Argo CD supports retries using `restartPolicy: OnFailure` and pod backoff strategies, or by resyncing the application.

---

## üìå Real-World Scenarios

---

### üî∏ Scenario 1: **DB migration before applying app changes**

Use a **PreSync** job to run a migration script. This ensures that schema changes are applied before the app update.

---

### üî∏ Scenario 2: **Slack alert after successful sync**

Add a **PostSync** hook with a `curl` command to call Slack or Microsoft Teams webhook.

---

### üî∏ Scenario 3: **Rollback resources if sync fails**

Use a **SyncFail** hook that reverts critical services or alerts the team.

---

### üî∏ Scenario 4: **CI/CD integrated testing**

Define **Sync hooks** to run integration tests before/after syncing resources in your GitOps CI/CD flow.

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

* Use `restartPolicy: Never` for hook jobs.
* Use unique `metadata.name` for each hook (to avoid name collisions).
* Use `HookSucceeded` or `BeforeHookCreation` to clean up old jobs.
* Monitor hook logs via `kubectl logs job/<job-name> -n <namespace>`.
