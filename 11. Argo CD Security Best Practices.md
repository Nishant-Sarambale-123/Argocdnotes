## üîê 11. Argo CD Security Best Practices

Securing Argo CD is critical, especially when used in production to manage infrastructure and applications.

---

### ‚úÖ Key Best Practices

---

### 1. **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**

Argo CD supports fine-grained **RBAC policies** to define who can access what.

üîπ Configure in `argocd-rbac-cm` ConfigMap.

üî∏ Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: argocd-rbac-cm
  namespace: argocd
data:
  policy.default: role:readonly
  policy.csv: |
    p, role:admin, applications, *, */*, allow
    p, role:readonly, applications, get, */*, allow
    g, dev-team, role:readonly
```

Use roles like:

* `applications.get`: read-only
* `applications.sync`: deploy permission
* `applications.delete`: delete apps

---

### 2. **SSO Integration (OIDC via Dex)**

üîê Instead of static credentials, use **SSO (OIDC)** providers for authentication:

* GitHub
* GitLab
* Google
* LDAP
* Okta
* Azure AD

üî∏ Benefits:

* Centralized identity management
* Enforce 2FA, password policies
* Audit via corporate IdP

üî∏ Dex Example:

```yaml
connectors:
- type: github
  id: github
  name: GitHub
  config:
    clientID: $GITHUB_CLIENT_ID
    clientSecret: $GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET
    orgs:
    - name: my-org
```

---

### 3. **Restrict kubectl exec & port-forward**

These features allow shell and port access to pods and should be disabled unless absolutely required.

üî∏ Disable in `argocd-cm` ConfigMap:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: argocd-cm
data:
  exec.enabled: "false"
  portforward.enabled: "false"
```

---

### 4. **TLS & HTTPS Only**

Always enable HTTPS for the Argo CD API server/UI using TLS certificates.

* Use Ingress/Nginx + cert-manager + Let‚Äôs Encrypt
* Or self-signed certs in test environments

---

### 5. **Read-Only Admin Access**

Even admins should have read-only access by default. Use escalation only when needed.

---

### 6. **Restrict Clusters and Namespaces**

Limit each AppProject to allowed clusters and namespaces only:

```yaml
spec:
  destinations:
    - namespace: team-a
      server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
```

---

### 7. **Use ReadOnlyRootFilesystem for Argo Pods**

Harden pod-level security via securityContext:

```yaml
securityContext:
  runAsNonRoot: true
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
```

---

## üìå Real-World Scenarios

---

### üî∏ Scenario 1: SSO + RBAC per Team

* Integrate GitHub OIDC via Dex
* Map GitHub teams to Argo roles in `argocd-rbac-cm`

---

### üî∏ Scenario 2: Disabling exec in production

To prevent attackers from accessing pods via terminal, disable `kubectl exec`.

---

### üî∏ Scenario 3: RBAC-per-AppProject

Each team only gets access to their Argo CD project with sync-only or read-only access.

---

## üß† Interview Questions + Sample Answers

---

### Q1: **How do you enforce access control in Argo CD?**

**Answer:**
Via Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), configured in `argocd-rbac-cm`. You can define roles and bind them to users or groups using RBAC policies.

---

### Q2: **What‚Äôs the benefit of integrating Argo CD with SSO (OIDC)?**

**Answer:**
It enables centralized identity management, better audit logs, and security features like 2FA via an external provider (e.g., GitHub, LDAP, Okta).

---

### Q3: **Why should `exec` and `port-forward` be disabled in Argo CD?**

**Answer:**
These features allow shell or port access to application pods, which could be exploited. They should be disabled to reduce attack surface in production environments.

---

### Q4: **How do you ensure only the right team can deploy to their namespace?**

**Answer:**
Use `AppProject` with `destination` restriction and RBAC to bind only that team to the project. Example: allow team-a to deploy only to `team-a` namespace.

---

### Q5: **How would you secure Argo CD against privilege escalation?**

**Answer:**

* Use read-only roles by default.
* Avoid giving `*` access to any user or group.
* Use TLS, SSO, disable dangerous features, and audit logs.
